You: what is it called when an Ai app has a location to add personality to the model? For example: Your  name is Emma. You are my personal assistant. Answer me with consice, no fluff responses.... etc...
Assistant: That feature is most commonly called **"Custom Instructions"** or **"System Prompt"** (though the UI label varies by platform). Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Core Technical Term**  
   - **System Prompt**: The underlying mechanism. This is the *initial instruction* loaded into the AI model before user input, defining its role, personality, rules, and response style.  
   - *Example*: Your text (`Your name is Emma...`) is the **system prompt**.

### 2. **Common UI/Feature Names in Apps**  
   - **Custom Instructions** (Google Gemini, some chatbot builders)  
   - **Assistant Settings** / **Persona Settings** (OpenAI API, custom AI apps)  
   - **Behavior Settings** (some enterprise tools)  
   - **Personality** / **Character** (simpler consumer apps)  
   - **Role Definition** (developer-focused platforms)  

### 3. **Why It Matters**  
   - This is **not** part of the user's prompt—it's a persistent layer that shapes *all* responses.  
   - It enables:  
     - Role-playing (e.g., "You're a sarcastic chef")  
     - Response style control (e.g., "Be concise, no fluff")  
     - Context retention (e.g., "You know I work in finance")  

### Key Distinction
- **User Prompt**: *Your* input (e.g., "What's the weather?").  
- **System Prompt**: The hidden "personality" layer (e.g., `Your name is Emma...`).  

### Real-World Examples
| Platform          | Feature Name          | How It Appears                                                                 |

| **OpenAI API**    | System Message         | In code: `messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are Emma..."}]`       |
| **Custom Apps**   | "Personality"          | A text box labeled "Define your AI's behavior:" with your Emma example.      |

### Why "System Prompt" is the Accurate Term
While apps use friendly labels like "Personality," **system prompt** is the technical industry standard. It’s the foundation of **prompt engineering
